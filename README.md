# Unicorn Farm

This is an old :warning: **unfinished** project from 2015. It was supposed to be a game where you can find unicorn eggs underground and hatch them. For now you can just walk around in a small labyrinth map defined in a png.

## Quick Start

Build (tested on ubuntu 22.04 LTS)
```
sudo apt install g++ libsfml-dev
./build.sh
```
Run (needs to be called from that directory for now..)
```
./build/unicorn_farm
```
